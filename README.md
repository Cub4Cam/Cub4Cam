disability check, open8ng accounts
with ny info abd not paying thwm
making new debit cards on my 
accounts and draining my 
balances, changing my passwords, 
gain8ng access to my email 
accounts, pretending to be me
and sending disturbing messages
to others causing huge turmoil,
amoung many other violations to 
me in the name of vengeance and 
punishnent meant to ruin me   
i want to access her phone foeb
not only gatherinf proof for
prosecution, but also to keep 
a close eye on her spying so
i can be prepared and plan how 
stop esch violation before shc
can implement them. 
Im no kind of hacker but could
use all the skills and hacker
tricks i can gather from all
of my new github family and 
friends.
im looking for collaborators
gifted in the art of spying
and hacking willing to shar
their craft with me in the
nake of fairness and leveling up
the playground so to speak 
Time to take my life back, 
take care of unfinished 
businesd, ans put an end 
to this evil abd dangerous
game ive been made to bear
for 6 years now and claim 
the victory!
